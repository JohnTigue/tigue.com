<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html">The New York Times' ebola visualization</a> sets the bar for high quality interactivity.

That makes sense as Mike Bostock works at the Times. He is one the creators of <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3">D3.js</a> which is the open source engine behind most of the gorgeous data-driven visualizations on the Web these days. If you have not yet seen it, <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery">the D3.js examples gallery</a> is a whole lot of eye candy.

Take this outbreak visualization as confirmation that any open-source white label outbreak widget should be based on D3.js.
