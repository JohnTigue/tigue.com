What a strange and disturbing journey this whole ebola research project has proved to be.

As one CDCer said of ebola:
["Itâ€™s a gruesome and merciless diseases"](http://fedscoop.com/cdcs-big-data-defense-ebola/) but if
[put in its historical context ebola is weak](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141025-ebola-epidemic-perspective-history-pandemic/).

But the medical details of the disease are not what I am talking
about. What freaks me out how there woefully underprepared we are as a
global society for epidemiological outbreaks. When it comes to global
health defense systems, there is no there there.

A major take away may well be that those preppers types are on to
something, sadly they underestimate the scale of the problem, as
illustrated in [Preparing for the Coming Influenza
Pandemic](http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/files/ComingPandemic.pdf),
written by a doctor. If you want to read more about the big flu:
- [The Influenza Pandemic of 1918](https://virus.stanford.edu/uda/),
Stanford has a good page which includes "Graphs of the Influenza Epidemic 
Impact."
- [A flutracker page](http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3546) also has The Grim Reaper by Louis Raemaekers and scanned charts from Kansas 1918
- [It All Started in Kansas](http://www.worldwar1.com/tgws/rel002.htm]) by David Brownm an article from Washington Post Weekly Edition Vol. 9, Num. 21, March 23-30, 1992
