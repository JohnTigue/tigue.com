What a strange and disturbing journey this whole ebola research project proved to be (more on that later).

As one CDCer said of ebola: ["Itâ€™s a gruesome and merciless diseases"](http://fedscoop.com/cdcs-big-data-defense-ebola/) but if [put in its historical context ebola is weak](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141025-ebola-epidemic-perspective-history-pandemic/). 

But the medical details of the disease are not what I am talking about. What freaks me out how there woefully underprepared we are as a global society for epidemiological outbreaks.

A major take away may well be that those preppers types are on to something, sadly [they underestimate the scale of the problem](http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/files/ComingPandemic.pdf).
