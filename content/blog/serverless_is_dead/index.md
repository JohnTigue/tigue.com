AWS dropped a lot of goodies for re:Invent 2020. A few of the announcement really caught
my attention.

The particular re:Invent announcements that inspired this writing
include:
- [New for AWS Lambda -- Container Image Support](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-container-image-support/)
- [Introducing AWS Step Functions integration with Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-aws-step-functions-integration-with-amazon-eks/)
- [New for AWS Lambda -- 1ms Billing Granularity Adds Cost Savings](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-1ms-billing-granularity-adds-cost-savings/)
- [Introducing Amazon EKS Distro - an open source Kubernetes distribution used by Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-amazon-eks-distro)

Jasse set the context and themes of re:Invent in his keynote address
