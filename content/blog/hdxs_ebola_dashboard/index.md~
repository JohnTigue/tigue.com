<a href="https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/">The Humanitarian Data Exchange</a> is doing great work and they have <a href="https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/about">a well defined road map</a> they are plugging away at.

<a href="https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/dataset/rowca-ebola-cases">The sub-national time series dataset</a> hosted there is the first data feed I am using to test <a href='https://github.com/JohnTigue/EbolaMapper/wiki/'>EbolaMapper</a> against.

They have a very nice, interactive <a href="https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/ebola">ebola dashboard</a>. The story of <a href="http://docs.hdx.rwlabs.org/a-new-ebola-crisis-page-built-with-open-data/">how the dashboard came to be</a> is impressive but I want to work to make that tortured path not have to be traveled for future outbreaks.

They do not have case mapped to locations over time. For that <a href='/by-time/2014/11/13/nytimes-the-pace-car/'>The New York Times is the best</a>.
