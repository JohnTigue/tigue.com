I have something I want to express; time to blog up. So, tooling: what to use these days?

- I am completely addicted to [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/). The syntax org uses is kind of a markdown variant. It has become my native written English "dialect." So, blogging in org syntax is a major goal. Org has excellent export capabilities. Perhaps exporting will not even come [into](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-ruby.html) [play](https://gist.github.com/abhiyerra/7377603) but it is a nice fallback to have in store. 
- When architecting, I love to use static content as much as possible so a static site generator seems like the right type of machinery to choose for blogging.
- I'm all about that open source so GitHub is in the picture. GitHub uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to host static pages.

So, Plan A is: org to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) to Jekyll, with [Octostrap](http://kaworu.github.io/octostrap3/) to make it pretty via Bootstratp. Here, Bootstrap is dailed in to look a lot like GitHub. So, that is Octopress looking like Github via Bootstrap. Let's call it... [octopussy](https://github.com/JohnTigue/octopussy) [in deference to Oxley's original intent](http://pando.com/2013/07/08/original-github-octocat-designer-simon-oxley-on-his-famous-creation-i-dont-remember-drawing-it/), more on that later.
