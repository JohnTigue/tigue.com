Omolumeter v0.4.2 has been released. This release coincides with the launch of [omolumeter.com](http://omolumeter.com), which is where future releases will be published from now on.

<a title='Omolumeter v0.4.2' href='http://omolumeter.com/'><img src='{{site.cdn_bucket}}twumbshot/{{page.twitter_image_src}}' class='center' alt='Omolumeter v0.4.2' /></a>

Omolumeter is liberally licensed open source software for visualizing epidemic outbreaks. Compared to the previous significant release, v0.4.2 has
two new visualizations: [a time series table](http://omolumeter.com/timeseries) with national flags, and [an epicurve](http://omolumeter.com/epicurves) which charts the deaths over time in the countries most heavily affected.
