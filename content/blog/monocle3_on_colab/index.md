[Monocle 3](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/) is "an analysis toolkit for single-cell RNA-seq." It is [MIT](https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle3/blob/master/LICENSE.md) code out of Seattle's Seattle Lake Union area. The source code is all R.

I hacked on Colab to see if I could get it to run Monocle3. The experiment went pretty well.

Migth as well use the above OpenInColab button to check it out but
the code can also be found on GitHub in the repo, [@reconstrue/single_cell_on_colab](https://github.com/reconstrue/single_cell_on_colab/tree/master/tools/monocle)
