               Actually they are the same thing. Collection indexing is simply a more PC name in the formal HTTP terminology.
               
            </li>
            <br><br>

               Here "directory" is from file system terminology.

            <br><br>
            
            <li>
               The word "collection" is more general and comes from HTTP terminology.
               
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li>
               For example, a collection index could be the result set of a database query, or it could be a static 
               HTML page handcrafted by a human.

               Collection indexing is widely implemented:
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>IIS has "directory browsing"</li>

               Historically was for <b>humans</b> to navigate sites; spiders and robots could them partially.
               Implementations predate XML.

               No standards address collection indexing so implementations are divergent.
               Basically, HTTP spec was supposed to be content agnostic; is specifies the headers not the entity body.
               This is changing with things like WebDAV.

         <title>Motivational example</title> 
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>Consider an XML based application with data stored on a Web server.</li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li>The data is stored in multiple resources which are XML documents, all located in some URL subtree.
               On the URL subtree, documents are leaf nodes.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li>	
               The collection(s) containing the resources are part of that URL subtree.
               The collection pages are internal, non-leaf nodes in the URL subtree.
               They should be XML as well.
               
            </li>
            
            <br><br>
            
            
            <li>
               For an XML document set which spans multiple collections on a Web server URL subtree, the set of collection index
               pages for all those collections is the "spine" of the data structure. 
               Essentially the physical structure of the data structure starts at the collection index page 
               of the subroot assigned to the document set.
               Topic Maps et al are a level up, that is, they are the logical structure not the physical. 
               
            </li>
            
            <br><br>
            
            <li>
               The web server will automatically update the collection index page if a new resource is added to the collection.
               Only with collection indexing can this be realized safely. 
               To do something like repeatedly updating index.html invites a race condition.
               
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li>
               So, on a static, file system based, vanilla Web server the collection indexing is the only dynamic mechanism.
               So, by making the collection pages XML compatible, a dynamic XML based application can be hosted on the
               simplest of Web servers.

               Adding XSL can enables sorting resources by properties in a table without returning to the server for each new 
               sort ordering.
               That is, FancyIndexing can be implemented on client side now so easier on server workload.
               But markup is still weak so XSL style sheet in tightly bound to XML. Can make that better.

               Need to stay inside HTML so can't make new elements, only new attributes.

               XLink is supposed to have a way for XHTML linking semantics to be recognized as such.

               By adding XLink attributes to collection index pages, a vanilla, static Web server can
               be used as a dynamic XLink storage system. Essentially a very rudimentary XLink repository.

            <li>
               Need more attributes on markup around resource properties such as size and type.
               This way clients do not need to depend on element ordering to determine which properties are which.
               Currently the information structure is not exposed completely to an XML client because of insufficient mark up.
               
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li>
               This is like 'http-equiv', that is,  declares equivalence between entity body info and header info.
               This is very much like WebDAV PROPFIND on a collection.
               
            </li> 
            <br><br>
            
            <li>
               There needs to be a standard for these attributes and the formats of data such as expressing dates in ISO8601.
               More generally, there needs to be a Note on how to map equivalence of data expressed in HTTP headers and in HTTP
               entities.
